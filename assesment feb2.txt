1)shifting letters says that we have given a string s and an array shifts.
now for each shifts[i]=x we want the first i+ 1 letters of s,x times.we have to return the final string after all shifts are applied 
explanation:-
------------
we start with "abc"
after shifting the first letter of s by 3 we have "dbc"
after shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5,we have"igc"
after shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9,we have "rpl"

program:-
--------
n="abc"
li=[3,5,9]
li1=[]
for i in range(len(li)):
    s=ord(n[i])+sum(li[i:])
    li1.append(chr(s))
print("".join(li1))

output:-
-------

rpl
